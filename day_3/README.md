DAY 3 OF THE SE_DISCIPLINE_GAME

To day is another day to go. still vibing deep into
loops in C Programing. haven looked at "for loops"
in the previous days. to day i am diving into "WHILE LOOP"

which it syntax is as follow:

while(expression)
{
    statement--1
    statement--2
    statement--3
    '
    '
    '
}
 this loop allow a setting block to keep repeting untill the provided condition 
 in the expression fail. but as long its true the block of statment keep runing.
 more so the expression are most times a boolian.
